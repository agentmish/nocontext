# Task Decomposition

```md [v1-simple]
# Task Decomposition Rule (V1)

1. Rewrite the user request into a single **primary objective**.
2. Ask clarifying questions if any ambiguity exists.
3. Break the objective into an **ordered list** of atomic subtasks where each:
   • delivers one artifact (file edit, test, doc).  
   • has no internal AND/OR clauses.  
   • can be completed in ≤ 20 min by a single agent.
4. After listing subtasks, output a summary table with columns `id`, `goal`, `artifact`, `completion-test`.
5. Stop planning when every acceptance criterion is covered by at least one subtask.
6. Emit the plan before writing any code.

```md [v2-react]
# Task Decomposition Rule (V2)

Follow a **Think → Act → Critique** loop:

1. **Think**: Restate the user’s goal and detect ambiguities. If unclear, ask questions.
2. **Act**: Propose a subtask (small, testable). Immediately identify the tool(s) needed.
3. **Critique**: Evaluate the subtask against INVEST & SMART. If it fails, revise it.
4. Repeat until the full objective is covered. Limit iterations to 15 subtasks.
5. Assemble the subtasks into a dependency graph (YAML list with `requires:` keys).
6. Present the graph plus a rationale section explaining major design choices.
```

```md [v3-dag]
# Task Decomposition Rule (V3)

Produce a **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG) of subtasks:

1. Clarify the primary objective; annotate open questions.
2. Identify independent work streams; create nodes for each atomic unit.
3. Draw edges only when a subtask’s output is a prerequisite for another.
4. Encode the DAG as a table with columns `node`, `depends_on`, `artifact`, `test`.
5. Insert **quality gates**: every edge must cite the artifact consumed.
6. Output the DAG JSON before execution so downstream agents can schedule tasks in parallel.
